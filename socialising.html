                     It’s important to take time off the farm and do something that you enjoy. The stress of farming can easily mount up so its a good idea to take time to refresh yourself and reset. Its also good to have like minded people around you that are experiencing similar problems as you and have similar feelings. Knowing that you're not alone is a big help. Its also good having people around you that have already experienced the situation your facing because they can share how they felt about it and how they resolved the problem. Their advice and support can take a massive weight off you shoulderS.

                        <li><b>Social groups</b> - Social groups can provide that opportunity to get away from the farm and have fun spending time with the company from people you like. As well as this it helps you to socialise, and connect with these like minded people who can support you through the problems you face.</li>
                        <li><b>Family and friends</b> - Take time to spend time witht he people you care about. This social time is a crucial part of everyone's life so it can be largely beneficial to us if we take more time to spend with them.</li>
                        <li><b>Invest in staff connections</b> - The social aspect within your work team is an important one. It is a good idea to spend time outside of a work environment connecting with staff and strengthening the team bond which will also make working more enjoyable in the future. </li>
