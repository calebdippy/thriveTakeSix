                        Surfing For Farmers is a unique opportunity for New Zealand farmers to take a break from their all-consuming businesses and engage in outdoor activities, enjoy fresh air, exercise, and connect with fellow farmers, rural families, and industry professionals.

  "It’s really nice to even hear the struggles of other people because you know you're not alone on this, isolating on your own farm. It's really good to connect with people in a similar situation with you. Just that aspect is quite nice. There's good camaraderie. And also just to do something completely different as well. And it breaks up your week. It's a really good idea and I’ve really enjoyed it. Also the fact that you can turn up whenever you want, you can leave whenever you want, you can go surfing for as long as you want, or you can also just stay on the beach and talk to people. It’s not really controlled per say, so it’s quite nice as well. Yeah it’s a really good idea." - Alex Diprose - Surfing for Farmers participant
