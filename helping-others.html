                    No one can find the solution to every problem by themselves. There will be times when asking someone else for advice will really help you. It is likely that the other people around you will have gone through challenges similar to what you’re facing. They can share about how they dealt with these challenges and this helps you to solve these challenges as well. It also just helps knowing that you aren’t the only one who has been in that spot and that you're not alone. It is a good idea to find out the people around you that you can have conversations with, and where you can go if you need further assistance.

                    <ul class=paragraph-small>
                         <li><b>Take the lead</b> - If you think someone is feeling down, or even just in normal conversation, don't be afraid to ask how someone is feeling. Even if they don't want to talk, it helps them to know that you are there for them. </li>
                         <li><b>Ask how you can help</b> - Sometimes people want help at different times. They might find it easier to text or email you rather than face to face because it means they can say things when they're ready. Keep checking in on them to see how they are doing. This lets them know that you are willing to help them and then if they do need help they know they can talk to you.</li>
                         <li><b>Who can help you</b> - Identify the people you can talk to. Write down a list of all the people who you are close to and you’d be happy to talk to. Some people will be better to talk to for different challenges so it is helpful if you can write more people down. </li>
