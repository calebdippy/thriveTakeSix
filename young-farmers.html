  "It’s nice to be around people my own age, in a similar boat as well. It definitely helped when I first started farming, because when you go into something new, you sort of have a bit of an identity crisis. It’s nice to be around people that have already established their personality and that kind of thing. It was really good initially starting out. And there’s lots of involvement in the community as well. Like Agri-kids is tomorrow so I’m helping volunteer. So it helps you to be a better person too." - Alex Diprose - Young Farmers member
